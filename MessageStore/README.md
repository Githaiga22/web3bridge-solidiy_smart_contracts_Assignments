# Web3Bridge Assignment: MessageStore Smart Contract

This project is part of the Web3Bridge initiative, which aims to educate developers on writing Solidity smart contracts. The focus of this assignment is the `MessageStore` smart contract, which demonstrates how to store and retrieve messages on the Ethereum blockchain.

## About the Project

The `MessageStore` smart contract allows users to save a message on the blockchain and retrieve it later. This project is built using React and Vite to provide a frontend interface for interacting with the smart contract. It leverages modern web development tools and practices, including Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules.

## Features

- **Smart Contract**: Written in Solidity, the `MessageStore` contract enables storing and retrieving messages on the blockchain.
- **Frontend Interface**: Built with React and Vite, the app provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the smart contract.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Connects to the Ethereum blockchain using Web3 or Ethers.js to facilitate transactions and data retrieval.

## Tools and Plugins Used

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
